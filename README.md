# **Rolling Bank**

## Project Description

The Rolling Bank project is a project wrote in HTML5 and CSS3. It has four different pages. It is a project where flexbox, position, and grid systems were practiced. The idea was to achieve a fully responsive bank project for all devices, the latter could be done through media queries and by having used a grid system. 

This project is NOT FUNCTIONAL. The idea was to carry out a project based on a design already made. You only see the frontend practice since it is a project that does not have a backend. Although CSS and HTML were used for this project Bootstrap was also used. Many of the components used are HTML code directly from it. It has a contact page, 404 error, security, prices and an index. All pages are related to each other to make it easier for the user to navigate.

## Git Branches

In this project, we use two branches. Here is an overview of them:

**master:** The `master` branch is our main branch. We use pull requests to bring what was developed in the development branch. In certain cases we worked directly from this branch. 

**development:** The `development` branch is our secondary branch. Here we carried out a large part of the project and through the creation of pull requests the code was merged to the master branch. Of course the merge code was made as reviewed by me before merging since this is an individual project and has no reviewers.
